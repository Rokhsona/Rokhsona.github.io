# Welcome to My Portfolio

I enjoy learning statistics and data analytic tools to solve the real-world problems.

I have experienced in analysing big data projects. The projects I have completed include:
1. Bike-Share large Data
2. Market Analysis using Data mining tools 
3. Examined different factors that might contribute to infantâ€™s low birth weight by using predictive model for future cases.

4. Whether an individual will have to file an insurance claim or not by using logistic regression model.

5. Time series analysis on monthly unemployment rate from the year 1975 to 2017.

6. Examined the effect of serum cholesterol on age and gender and estimated the mssing values by using Multiple Imputation technique.

7. Evaluated performance of an employee based on different factors by using regression model.

8. One-Sided and Partially One-Sided LR Test for Testing Multiparameter Regression Coefficient Restricted Under Alternative Hypothesis-
   A Monte Carlo Simulation Study.



Project: Bike-Share large Data
In this project, we analyzed ou data using R. We intalled required packages like ggplot2 and dplyr to finish 
this project.
